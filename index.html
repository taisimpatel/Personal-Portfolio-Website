            <h3>Plant Leaf Disease Detection Using Image Processing</h3>
            <p class="project-description">Identification of the plant diseases is the key to
                preventing the losses in the yield and quantity of the agricultural
                product. The studies of the plant diseases mean the studies of
                visually observable patterns seen on the plant. Health monitoring
                and disease detection on plant is very critical for sustainable
                agriculture. It is very difficult to monitor the plant diseases
                manually.

                    It requires tremendous amount of work, expertize in the
                    plant diseases, and also require the excessive processing time.
                    Hence, image processing is used for the detection of plant diseases.
                    Disease detection involves the steps like image acquisition, image
                    pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and
                    classification.</span>

            <h3>IoT Based Advanced Rationing System Using RFID Technology</h3>
            <p class="project-description">One of the most disputed topics connected to malpractice is the PDS
                (Public Distribution System), which is also known as the ration distribution system. Rice, ragi,
                sugar,
                red gram dal, wheat, and cooking oil are regularly provided to those living below the poverty line
                (BPL) on a monthly basis through the Public Distribution System of India. The old ration card,
                which is often used by the government to supply food grains and other items to a specific class of
                people in society at a discounted rate, is replaced by the smart ration card.

                    The project's goal is to effectively automate the process of item distribution.
                    The project aims to halt fraud and inconsistencies produced in distribution stores.
                    Here, the system needs to accomplish the following: Verify beneficiaries' Smart Ration Cards;
                    prevent anomalies in the distribution of food; notify recipients mobile devices via SMS notice;
                    maintain inventory in the distribution center.</span>

            <h3>DC Motor Speed Controller Using Arduino</h3>
            <p class="project-description">TWO buttons are used in this project, one each for forward & reverse direction of the
                 motor. Two buttons are connected to pin 13 and 12 of Arduino which are internally pulled up 
                 (cusing code). The Other terminals of the buttons are connected to ground & hence when button,
                 is pressed the microcontroller detect to Low (logic 0) The output of the POT is on analog Signal and 
                 hence it is connected to analog pin of the arduino based on analog voltage value the speed of motor is
                  varied. For this to happen we need to use the concept of PWM in the circuit the inputs to the motor
                   driver IC must be in the form of a PWM signal There are connected to pin 11 and 10 of aurduino 
                   respectively, which are capable of generating Pwm Signal. TWO buttons are used in this project, one

                    When the system is powered ON, Arduino waits for a button to be pressed If the
                    forward direction button is pressed the arduino drives input 1 of motor driver lc (pin 2) with PWM
                    signal
                    and logic low to input 2 (pin 3).
                    Hence, the motor starts rotating in forward direction Similarly, if the reverse direcion button is
                    pressed. Arduino drives input 2(Pin 3) of L293D Motor driver Ic with the PWM signal input 1(Pin2) of
                    L293D is given a logic low in reverse directions.Hence motor starts rotating in reverse
                    The speed of the motor
                    in either direction can be controlled using the POT as it controls the duty cycle of the output pwm

                used for uncomplicated temperature measurement Thermistors are temperature Sensitive resistors.
                when temperature increases resistance offered by thermistor decreases and vice versa. At normal temp the
                resistance of the thermistor. is arround 1ok ohms.All resistors vary with temperature,

                the transistor is turn ON by voltage drop across resistor R1 Consider the temperature of atmosphere is
                around
                25°c and then the resistance of thermistor is high so the voltage across thermistor is high according to
